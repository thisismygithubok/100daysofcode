print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) # ends up being (3*3) + (3/3) - 3 which is 9 + 1 - 3 = 7

#Change above to get result of 3

print(3 / 3 * 3 + 3 - 3) #moved operations around to get result of 3
print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3) #This was the intended result I guess? To not move operators around but instead () the 3+3 to get the desired result of 3
