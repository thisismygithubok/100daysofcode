# This is an input example, i.e. a prompt for user to input data
    # input("What is your name? : ")

# Input w/ automatic print after user input
    # print("Hello, " + input("What is your name? : ") + "!")

# Take user's name/string input and print our character count
    # print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# Here's how you'd store these into variables to make it more concise
name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)

print(length)
